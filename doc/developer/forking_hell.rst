=======================================
Making your own copy (fork) of NetworkX
=======================================

You need to do this only once.  The instructions here are very similar
to the instructions at https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/ — please see
that page for more detail.  We're repeating some of it here just to give the
specifics for the `NetworkX`_ project, and to suggest some default names.

.. _NetworkX: https://networkx.github.io

Set up and configure a github account
=====================================

If you don't have a github account, go to the github page, and make one.

You then need to configure your account to allow write access — see
the ``Generating SSH keys`` help on `GitHub help`_.

Create your own forked copy of NetworkX
=======================================

#. Log into your github account.
#. Go to the `NetworkX`_ github home at `NetworkX GitHub`_.
#. Click on the *fork* button:

   Now, after a short pause and some 'Hardcore forking action', you
   should find yourself at the home page for your own forked copy of `NetworkX`_.
